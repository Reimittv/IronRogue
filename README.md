# Iron Rogue Ruleset
A Pokemon challenge in which you must beat Eternatus in PokeRouge Classic mode while adopting the following restrictions:



| Rules | Explanation |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| New Friends  | You must randomly generate a starting team of 3 Pokemon using this randomizer https://ptgigi.com/apps/pokemon/randomizer/   |
| Stored Power  | Your randomly selected team can use any additional unlocks you have at your disposal - i.e. Shinies, IVs, Egg Moves, Abilities etc.  |
| Flying Blind | You cannot buy the map item, biome selection is random.  |
| Slapdash Shopper | You cannot buy the fixed items from the shop, random ones only. |
| Permadeath | A Pokemon that faints can no longer be used in fights or intentionally revived for the rest of the run.  |
| One Shot | No save scumming whatsoever, if a server issue occurs then replay the fight in the exact same way up until that point. |
| No Dupes | You can only have one Pokemon of any specific species/line in your team (including fused Pokemon)  |
| Mad Scientist | You MUST fuse 2 of your Pokemon if the DNA Splicer is in the shop. |
| Power Limiter | You cannot start the run with nor catch any Pokemon that is 580 BST or higher, Evolving/Mega Evolving/Gigantomaxing into one is fine.  |
| Plan Ahead | You may catch any Pokemon you like, even if it breaks the above rules such as Legendaries or a Shiny of a species you already own. But you cannot use it in battle and must store it in the PC as soon as possible.  |
